Oyster is an abstract, lightweight GUI thingy for use in a 3d setting. It handles 
basic 2d polygons and text using texture atlases. Not specific to any 3d engine,
outputs simple raw mesh data that can easily be adapted to work with any rendering 
setup (and screen-aligned or whatever you need with it).

Inspired by Gorilla, an excellent lightweight GUI system for OGRE3d.

And about the name... I have no clue, first thing that came to mind.

This is a quick hacky creation for my own needs, but I've always wanted to release
something under the WTFPL, so there ya go.
